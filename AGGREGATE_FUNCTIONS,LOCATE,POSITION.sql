-- WHERE is a clause used to filter out specific rows from a table based on given conditions.
select * from customer where store_id=1 and active=0;  -- fetch result if both store_id=1 and active=0, means true for both scenario
select * from customer where store_id=1 or active=0;   -- fetch result even if one stuation is true
select * from customer where customer_id=1;
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE customer_id != 3 AND customer_id != 1;  -- exclude customer_id=1 and 3
select *from customer where customer_id <> 1 and customer_id <> 3;
select *from customer where not customer_id=1;


SELECT * FROM customer WHERE NOT (customer_id = 3 and customer_id = 1); -- Syntax is correct, 
-- But logic is unnecessary. Why? because A customer_id cannot be 3 and 1 at the same time.

SELECT * FROM customer WHERE NOT (customer_id = 3 or customer_id = 1); # filter out where c_id !=1 and !=3
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE NOT (customer_id = 3 or customer_id = 1 or customer_id=2); # c_id other than 1,2,3

-- membership operator : to check if a value is present in any iterable
-- 1. IN OPERATOR: Checks if a value belongs to a set of values.
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE 20 IN (ADDRESS_ID);

-- 2. NOT IN OPERATOR: NOT IN is used to get the rows where the column's value is not found in the given list.
-- Parentheses are used for lists in IN() or NOT IN(), but if you write just (ADDRESS_ID), 
-- it is interpreted as a single-column list, not a tuple
-- In SQL, (10, 20, 30) is a list of scalar values, not a tuple.
-- It's called an "IN list" or "value list".
-- SELECT * FROM orders WHERE (customer_id, order_id) IN ((1, 101), (2, 102), (3, 103));
-- Here, ((1, 101), (2, 102)) are tuples because youâ€™re comparing pairs of values.

-- LIKE : The LIKE operator is used in SQL to perform pattern-based searches on string or text data.
